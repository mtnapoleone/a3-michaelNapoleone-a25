## Car Age List - Server Basics
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
HTML: 1. /results page 2. form 3. link to google font 4. input fields
CSS: added styling for 1. form 2. table 3. inputs and 4. buttons with colors and positioning (used flex, center, aligning)
JS: added results to get server data, submit to post data, and also to put data for the extended activity
Made it so the app can derive age dynamically when the year of the car is inputted

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: shows an updating list on the main page that updates when the server updates
- **Tech Achievement 2**: ability to edit the car when click on the edit button, the regular form changes to editing the car

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: conducted speak aloud with 1 friend(as seen below)

  Problems: The coloring did not appear well on their laptop when they had force dark mode on opera enabled
  Surprising Comments: I was surprised to hear that the edit button functionality seemed very intuitive, i thought it was a little funky
  Changes: I would edit the css further for an actual web app, i just made it pretty basic for this assignment.
